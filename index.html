  <h1>
    The Croissant ü•ê of Aroma Napoletano
  </h1>
  <p>
    Croissants as trendy as the neighbourhood. We catapult ourselves to Via Tra√π, in Isola, to taste one of the
    croissants - there are also an extra large size - from <strong>Aroma Napoletano.</strong>
    <br>
    They are, to be precise, Ischia croissants, particularly colourful. The giant ones can weigh up to a kilo, perfect
    for a birthday or an event that deserves to be celebrated properly.
    <br>
    The cornetto of Ischia is born from the union of croissant and brioche dough but with a double dough that
    makes it more delicious.
    <br>
    The brioche are scenic, very Instagrammable, with bright colours ranging from red to green,
    but above all they are good.
    <br>
    The croissant is empty but also filled with cream.For those who just can't be
    satisfied, there is also a bigusto version.
